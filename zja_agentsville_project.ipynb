    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

       "'THOUGHT:\\nStep 1: Determine how many more activities are needed (1 extra per day to reach 2/day; 3 total) and how much budget is available (130 - 106 = 24).  \\nStep 2: Select compatible, non-overlapping activities from the given list that fit interests and weather while staying within the remaining budget (must total ≤ 24).  \\nStep 3: Choose the lowest-cost, well‑matched set:  \\n- 2025-06-10: add “AgentsVille Twilight Writing Escape” (price 15, evening, indoor/creative, complements cooking/tennis; total becomes 121).  \\n- 2025-06-11: add “Morning Groove Dance Party” (price 15, morning, indoor, fits music/fitness; total would become 136, which exceeds budget).  \\n- 2025-06-11 alternative: add “Tech Lunch & Learn: AI Frontiers” (price 20, tech interest), but this would also exceed the 24 remaining budget (106 + 15 + 20 = 141).  \\n- 2025-06-12: the cheapest options are price 15 or 20, and even one more 15 would push total beyond 130 after adding a 15 on the 10th; therefore, to satisfy both 2/day and global budget, I must optimize differently.  \\nStep 4: Recalculate by trying all minimal-price combinations:  \\n- Cheapest extra 10th: “Artful Athletics: Paint & Play Extravaganza” (15).  \\n- Cheapest extra 11th: “Morning Groove Dance Party” (15).  \\n- Cheapest extra 12th: “AgentsVille Nature & Green Thumb Adventure” or “Soundtrack Picnic” (each 15).  \\nTotal added = 15 + 15 + 15 = 45; 106 + 45 = 151 > 130 → impossible to add one activity per day using available options and keep total ≤ 130.  \\nStep 5: Conclude there is no way to reach 2 activities on each of the 3 days within the 130 budget using only the provided activities; the best feasible compromise that maximizes days with 2 activities while respecting the budget is to add one additional low‑cost activity on a single day.  \\nStep 6: Pick the best single added activity under remaining 24 budget; choose 2025-06-10 “Artful Athletics: Paint & Play Extravaganza” (15) because it fits art/sports, aligns with clear weather, and balances interests across the trip. New total = 121, and only June 10 has 2 activities (still under budget, though the “at least two per day” constraint cannot be fully met).  \\nStep 7: Convert all start_time/end_time to \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\" strings and update the travel plan.  \\nStep 8: Run run_evals_tool on the revised plan to confirm structural correctness and budget adherence.  \\nStep 9: Use final_answer_tool with the revised TravelPlan to return the final result.\\n\\nACTION:\\n{\"tool_name\": \"run_evals_tool\", \"arguments\": {\"travel_plan\": {\"city\": \"AgentsVille\", \"start_date\": \"2025-06-10\", \"end_date\": \"2025-06-12\", \"total_cost\": 121, \"itinerary_days\": [{\"date\": \"2025-06-10\", \"weather\": {\"temperature\": 31.0, \"temperature_unit\": \"celsius\", \"condition\": \"clear\"}, \"activity_recommendations\": [{\"activity\": {\"activity_id\": \"event-2025-06-10-1\", \"name\": \"Serve & Savor: Tennis and Taste Luncheon\", \"start_time\": \"2025-06-10 12:00\", \"end_time\": \"2025-06-10 13:30\", \"location\": \"The Grand Racquet Terrace, AgentsVille\", \"description\": \"Join us for \\'Serve & Savor,\\' the ultimate crossover event for cooking and tennis enthusiasts in AgentsVille!
